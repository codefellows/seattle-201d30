# Final Project Requirements and Rules

For your final project, your task is to work with a team to build a web site that simulates a real-world product, service, or game.

**Project Requirements**

Your team must adhere to the following requirements.

* Each person must make meaningful contributions in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Your web site must have at least 3 interlinked pages and clear navigation.
* Your web site must have at least 2 pages that accept and process user input.
* Your web site's state must persist between page reloads.
* Your web site must be deployed live on the Internet.

**Rules**

Here's the process that we'll be using for project week.
1. On the first day of project week, by noon, your team must submit a proposal to the instructional staff.
2. During project week, your team must work on-campus during lab time (9am - 6pm) so we can help whenever your team is stuck. This is not a week to leave early, arrive late, or work remotely.
3. Each day, we will conduct morning and afternoon standups. Your entire team must be present for standup. Morning standups begin at 9:30am, and afternoon standups begin at 3:30 pm.
4. On the last day of project week, your team must present your project in front of the class.
